## How do SIP Calculator Works

It works on the following formula –

M = P × ({[1 + i]^n – 1} / i) × (1 + i).

In the above formula –

M is the amount you receive upon maturity.
P is the amount you invest at regular intervals.
n is the number of payments you have made.
i is the periodic rate of interest.

Take for example you want to invest Rs. 1,000 per month for 12 months at a periodic rate of interest of 12%.

then the monthly rate of return will be 12%/12 = 1/100=0.01

Hence, M = 1,000X ({[1 +0.01 ]^{12} – 1} / 0.01) x (1 + 0.01)

which gives Rs 12,809 Rs approximately in a year.
